        <p className="card-text">
          My name is Colin Brooks. I am a self-taught Python programmer with an
          academic background in finance & investing. I have worked in
          commercial banking as a credit analyst and underwriter for the past
          four years and have a great interest in the investment industry. In
          the pursuit of career development, I have been looking to break into
          the tech industry which has spurred my enrollment into the Georgia
          Tech Coding Bootcamp in order to learn full-stack development.

          Over the past couple of years I have been teaching myself about
          artificial intelligence with deep learning & neural networks. Lately
          my personal side-projects have included the exploration of
          unsupervised learning for the purposes of stock trading using a
          customizes OpenAI Gym environment. I also am a co-founder and owner of
          a cryptocurrency mining company located in Melbourne, FL.
